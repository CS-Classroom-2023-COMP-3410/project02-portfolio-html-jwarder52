For this process, I decided to do one webpage at a time, trying to describe to chatGPT the entire webpage in one prompt. This worked out for the most part, but there plenty of bus on each page that needed to be fixed. What I found most annoying was chatGPT's bug fixing was not done well for me and I needed to manually debug a lot of the border, sizing, and color issues. What I found in the end was that I learned more from when chatGPT messed up since I had to manually fix the html, rather than when it succeeded, because I never got the hands on experience of actually coding the html.
