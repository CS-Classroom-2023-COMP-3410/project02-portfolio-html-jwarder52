For this process, I decided to do one webpage at a time, trying to describe to chatGPT the entire webpage in one prompt. This worked out for the most part, but there plenty of bus on each page that needed to be fixed. What I found most annoying was chatGPT's bug fixing was not done well for me and I needed to manually debug a lot of the border, sizing, and color issues. What I found in the end was that I learned more from when chatGPT messed up since I had to manually fix the html, rather than when it succeeded, because I never got the hands on experience of actually coding the html. The other tough part was connecting to the DU linux server. At first, I forgot my username before the @ so I ended up locking myself out, which cause me to be unable to connect to the server in the correct way for about 15 minutes. After that little hiccup however, the rest of the process copying the files was a bit simpler. The only issue I ran into was that one of my photos was named with capital letters which I had to change in order for it to work on the linux servers, even though it worked locally.
